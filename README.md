# ChatBot

This is a small ChatBot, that uses the Wit.ai API.

This bot can:

* Greet the user
* Tell the user what time it is (yeah!)
* Tell the user the weather in any city (defaulted to Paris if none is specified in the question.
	* This uses the *openweathermap.org's* API

### How to run it ?

Type:

	yarn install
	
or

	npm install
	
	
in the root folder.

After that, you can launch the server with

	node app.js
	
	
Connect to localhost:3000, and start conversing with the bot !
